# Queues

## What are queues? 
Queues are just like the line you have in a supermarket. You have a line that is First In and First Out. This is called FIFO structure. But what is the hype surrounding queues? 

## What can you use queues for? 
Queue data structures are commonly used in various scenarios where items or tasks need to be processed in a first-in, first-out order. Remember these are a few of the many ways that queues can be used!

1. Job Scheduling: In computer systems and networks, queues are used to handle job scheduling. Jobs are added to a queue and processed in the order they were received. 
2. Call Center Phone Systems: In call center phone systems, incoming calls are added to a queue, and customers are served in the order their calls were received. 
3. Online Multiplayer Games: In online multiplayer games, queues are often used to manage the order in which players join game sessions or matchmaking queues. 

## What can you do with Queue Data Structure? 
- Dequeue: deletes and returns the element that is at the front of the queue
- Enqueue: inserts the element at the back of the queue
- Peek: peeks at the front of the queue and returns the first element
- isEmpty: is the queue empty? It checks it
- isFull: is the queue full? It checks it
